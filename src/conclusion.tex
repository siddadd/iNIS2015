% Conclusion
In this paper we extensively survey a plethora of vision-based systems 
targeted for real-time applications. 
With shrinking technology, reliability will 
become exceedingly challenging and approximate computing will have more of a role to play when 
designing compute systems. We exploit the inherent robustness 
in vision algorithms and show that it can help to reduce both 
power and compute resources, both of which are valuable when designing such systems.
