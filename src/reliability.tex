%Architecture

Reliability is being explored at different layers of abstraction; from devices~\cite{Datta2014,Datta2015,Rahul2015} to memory~\cite{isca2014} to algorithms.
At a circuit-level, ~\cite{chen2015fast} uses a conditional probability approach for modeling reliability in combinational circuits.

\subsection{Reliability in Vision}
Fig.~\ref{fig:hmax_pixel_sensitivity} illustrates the resilience of HMAX to pixel errors.
