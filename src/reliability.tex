%Architecture

Reliability is being explored at different layers of abstraction; from devices~\cite{Datta2014,Datta2015,Rahul2015} to memory~\cite{isca2014} to algorithms.
At a circuit-level, ~\cite{chen2015fast} uses a conditional probability approach for modeling reliability in combinational circuits.
In this section, we discuss the key design points of the pipeline.
Figure~\ref{fig:sys_arch} illustrates the end-to-end system beginning with the PCIe host data interface.
