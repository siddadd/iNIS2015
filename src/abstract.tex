Vision and video applications are becoming pervasive in mobile and embedded systems. 
Consumer wearable devices require capabilities for real-time video analytics 
and prolonged battery lifetimes, which is further driving 
the need for innovative system designs 
with low-power, reliability and high performance. 
Further, the increasing resolution of image sensors in these mobile systems places an increasing demand on 
both the memory storage as well as the computational power. 
Such stringent requirements have given rise to accelerator-rich architectures in system-on-chips, where the 
primary computational burden is handled by dedicated hardware accelerators. In this paper we provide an overview of the 
current state-of-the-art in vision accelerators.
We further discuss the opportunities to improve energy efficiency 
by minimizing Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) refreshes and explore techniques to exploit algorithmic resilience for reduction in compute units
while maintaining reliable system accuracy and performance.
